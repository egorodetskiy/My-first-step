Typical UI testing checklist encompasses the following activities:

    1. Check font (font type and font size)

    2. Check for consistency (colors and visual elements)

    3. Check behavior of interactive elements (do the buttons, clicks, hovers, drag-and-drops, etc. work as intended?)

    4. Check spaces (paddings, borders, margins)

    5. Check page content is as per design (readable font, color, proper text alignment)

    6. Check the page in all standard resolutions (all page layouts are consistent and flawless across devices, ensuring that the UI elements adapt and are displayed correctly in  different sizes)

    7. Check layout (ensure that sections donâ€™t overlap each other)

    8. Check images displayed are not blurry
